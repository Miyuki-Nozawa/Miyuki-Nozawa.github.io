          Many people have experienced learning a foreign language or aspire to
          do so. Theyâ€™re motivated when they start learning, but they may
          stumble in their learning journey or realize that they lack enough
          time. These hurdles lead them to give up on learning the new language
          before reaching a level of satisfaction with their language
          proficiency.

          I&apos;ve learned several foreign languages, and I know many
          multilingual people. I&apos;ve also seen friends give up on learning
          new languages despite starting with clear goals. I wish there was a
          product to help them stay motivated and learn efficiently.
