            TOCHIGAMI is creating a web app to revolutionize real estate
            listings. Current real estate platforms lack <b>transparency</b> and{" "}
            <b>control</b>, preventing direct connections between <b>agents</b>{" "}
            and <b>consumers</b>. TOCHIGAMI addresses this by allowing agents to
            fully own their data and directly connect with consumers, enhancing
            trust and communication.

            The original web app provides limited details on key selection
            criteria such as qualifications, experience, and specialties,
            creating an information gap that undermines trust and complicates
            the process of choosing an agent.

            To identify the information users expect, the essential details

            compared well-known real estate websites in the US market. This
