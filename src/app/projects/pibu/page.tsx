          Pibu is a family-owned Korean skincare store located in New York City.
          They target individuals of all genders in their 20s to 40s and offer a
          variety of skincare products. Since opening their store just 6 months
          ago, they have not become widely known yet. Their customers are mainly
          local residents, and they are considering the development of a website
          and an e-commerce platform to expand their business. They are hoping
          to have a website that matches their target customers and the
          aesthetic of their store.

            First, I conducted a competitive analysis to understand the
            structure and features of general skincare e-commerce sites. I
            examined how competitors are providing their e-commerce sites, how
            they enhance user purchasing intent, and whether they have features
            that attract users.

          <ResearchSubsection title="Competitive Analysis" color="light-pink">
            <Text>
              I compared two direct websites specializing in K-beauty and one
              indirect website focusing on general skincare. Based on each
              site&apos;s brand value and target users, I identified how they
              are presenting their websites.

                While all e-commerce websites share basic functionalities, each
                one incorporates unique features tailored to their target users.
                Direct competitors have fewer products but offer a simple and
                very user-friendly layout. On the other hand, indirect
                competitors, with a broader range of brands and products, use
                icons and other design elements to make the vast amount of
                information more accessible.
              </Text>
              <Text>
                Through competitive analysis, I learned that understanding the
                information users need and how to present it is crucial. With
                many competitors in the market, unique features and content are
                essential for differentiating ourselves from others.
                Additionally, it&apos;s important to consider the functionality
                of the website to enhance users&apos; purchase motivation.

          After conducting research, reviewing the findings, and organizing the

            products, the structure was designed to ensure easy access to
            detailed information from the shop section.

          Pibu already has a developed store image, including the logo and
          aesthetic. Based on the brand image the stakeholders aim for, I chose
          typography and colors to attract users.

              Based on Pibuâ€™s brand values of clean, young, modern, and
              refreshing, I created two style tiles: one with a blue theme and
              one with a green theme. The blue style tile was selected by the
              stakeholder as the one that best aligns with the brand image.

                I chose Avenir Next because it offers a clean and modern look
                that aligns perfectly with Pibuâ€™s brand image. Its readability
                and elegant design enhance the aesthetic of a skincare brand.

                  For the main color, I chose a blue hue that conveys a clean
                  and refreshing feel. Among these, a slightly muted blue
                  provides a modern impression. For the secondary color, I
                  selected earth tones that give a modern and minimal look,
                  which closely aligns with the storeâ€™s image.

                  In order to make a user-friendly website, I conducted an

                  color-blindness.

            The users found it easy to determine their skin type and view
            product lists tailored to their skin type, but they struggled with
            comparing and finding the items that suited them best. Even after
            revising the item comparison process in the mid-fi prototype, they
            encountered new difficulties and found the process unclear.

          Through this project, I gained valuable, realistic experience by
          working directly with stakeholders to design the website. A key
          achievement was developing a website that allows users to address
          their primary challenge: identifying their skin type, based on
          research findings and stakeholder requirements. The biggest challenge
          was balancing research-based design decisions with stakeholder
          feedback. Despite working within a limited timeframe, the fast-paced
          changes in the cosmetics market emphasize the need for continuous
          updates to keep the website user-friendly and support business growth.
